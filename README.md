# Tebex.js

A Node.js client for the Tebex REST API written in Typescript. Easily interact with the Tebex REST API using this library.


# üöÄ Installation
```
npm install --save tebex.js
```

# üóíÔ∏è Getting started

Get your tebex secret at https://tebex.io

You can use `TebexClient` to generate an instance of the Tebex REST API, or you can use the `TebexRest` to interact with the Tebex REST API without creating a new instance.

# ‚öíÔ∏è Usage

_All the methods are documented with their respective types._

Using a `TebexClient` instance

```js
import { TebexClient } from 'tebex.js';
const TEBEX_SECRET = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

const client = new TebexClient(TEBEX_SECRET);

// Use client
(async () => {
const information = await client.information();
console.log(information)
});

```

Using `TebexRest`

```js
import { TebexClient } from 'tebex.js';
const TEBEX_SECRET = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";



// Use rest to fetch an specific endpoint
(async () => {
const information = TebexRest(TEBEX_SECRET).information();
console.log(information)
});

```

# ü§ñ API

The `TebexClient` and `TebexRest` returns an object based on the interface `ITebexRest`, it contains properties based on the Tebex API endpoints\
The endpoints could give an error based on an Invalid Tebex Secret, Not found object or a Server error (_Which shouldn't happen as the UknownError._) 
They extend the `BaseApiError` which has the `message` and `name` property.
